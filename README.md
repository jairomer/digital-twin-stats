# Latency measurements between a CoppeliaSim simulator and a ROS node over a WiFi network.

The purpose of this repository is to store the code and data used to analyze a set of latency measurements between a simulation in CoppeliaSim with different settings and a ROS node in order to identify the best configuration for real-time behaviour. 

To use this scripts, you will need to load a Python3 virtual environment and install the requirements:
```bash
cd digital-twin-stats
source virtualenv/bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

The tune the script on `src/analisis.py` to get what you want.  

Then run script './run' and enjoy or suffer the results of your actions.
