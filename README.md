# Latency measurements between a CoppeliaSim simulator and a ROS node over a WiFi network.

The purpose of this repository is to store the code used to analyze a set of latency measurements between a simulation in CoppeliaSim with different settings and a ROS node in order to identify the best configuration for real-time behaviour.
